# Weather App

This app allows you to search the weather of a given city, which returns the temperature in Â°C, a description of the weather, humidity, and wind speed. It's the result of 
this tutorial by Jonah Lawerence on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZNG8UomjSI. My goal was to practice front-end development with a simple project, and this 
exercise delivered. The app utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API, photos from Unsplash.com, Google Fonts, and React Icons (VS Code extention). The tutorial was very thorough 
and I learned alot:
- How to make fetch calls to an API with JavaScript.
- How to 'defer' the JavaScript to make the  website function in order.
- How to utilize browser development tools to add CSS to the website in real-time.
- How to read and utilize JSON formatted data.
- Learned the ":after" selector and the "background-size" property in CSS.

I aim to implement a way to let a user input both city/state or city/country in the search bar for convienience and specific results. For example, "Birmingham" can result 
in weather for "Birmingham, AL" when you want "Birmingham, Great Britian".




# How to Use:
- Download the current release and extract the files.
- Open index.html, and search any city you want.

Note:
  - This app strictly relies on CITY input in the search bar.
  - The app will not recognize states nor countries.
